Laser coordinate list handling

turret.py: 
update pos returns [x, y] of the muzzle of a single 
laser turret

ship.py: 
motion creates a list of positions (which are also 
lists) one position for each turret [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ..., 
[xN, yN]]
fire_lasers returns list created by motion but does this funky
thing where it returns a list of a list accessed at the
corresponding index

space_game_main.py:
whole file appends lists created by motion into one bigger list
[[[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ..., [xN, yN]], [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ..., [xN, yN]],
[[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ..., [xN, yN]]]
