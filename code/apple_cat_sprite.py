apple_cat_sprite.py is a class definition for the Applecat spaceship for use in our
python game. It needs to import the sprites of the ship hull and its turrets.
The role of this file is mostly graphics oriented.

Contains useful function: load_image

This doc takes a lot of advice from pygame.org/docs/tut
